# React Drag-and-Drop with Typescript

For that project I used that library

```
https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd

```

But I think react-beautiful-dnd is unmaintained.(since React 18)
So, the above one is much better

```
https://github.com/react-forked/dnd/blob/main/docs/about/installation.md
```

Or we can simply change
from this one :

```
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

to here:

```
root.render(<App />);
```
